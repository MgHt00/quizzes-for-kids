# quizzes-for-kids
A small project to demonstrate a quiz application for my client, "IIG Myanmar". The quiz will display a random question with multiple choice answers. It features a simple HTML and CSS layout, with JavaScript handling the main functionality and data stored in JSON format. The design is fully responsive as follows:

### Mobile Layout
<img src="assets/img/mobile-layout.jpg" alt="mobile layout">

### Tablet Layout
<img src="assets/img/tablet-layout.jpg" alt="tablet layout">

### Computer Layout
<img src="assets/img/computer-layout.jpg" alt="computer layout">
